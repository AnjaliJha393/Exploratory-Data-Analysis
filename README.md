# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
In Machine learning the first step we do is to collect data once we collect data the next step is to perform EDA-> Exploratory data analysis
### Libraries used :-
Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib,seaborn
### Before we feed data to machine there are certain things we need to take care of:-
 1) Handle Missing Values and treat null values.
 2) Handling outliers
 3) Handle skewness
 4) Apply LabelEncoder to the categorical column as machine only understands numeric data
 5) Scaling
 6) Feature Engineering
